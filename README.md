# Real-Time ECG Heartbeat Classification System

A complete **end-to-end machine learning pipeline** for real-time ECG heartbeat classification using signal processing, feature engineering, and supervised learning.  
This project simulates **live ECG monitoring** and performs **real-time predictions with visualization**.

> Data preprocessing → feature extraction → model training → live inference → real-time visualization.
